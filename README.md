The original racing userscript contained here for Torn (https://www.torn.com, an online RPG game) was written by Lugburz, a former player who is no longer active in the game. I have cloned his script here for ongoing maintenance so that it remains useable and updated for current players.

In order to use this script on PC, you need to have tampermonkey installed. It's available as extension for Firefox (including the Android version), Opera, Safari, and Chrome web browsers, among others. Go to https://www.tampermonkey.net or use your browser's own extension store to install it. Once you have tampermonkey installed, open the script you want to use and click "Raw" button. Then follow the prompt to install the script. That's it, enjoy!

If you are on mobile, I have also modified this script so that it is compatible with the Torn PDA app. Torn PDA can be found in the app store of both Apple and Android devices.
